# Clinical Trial Results: Zenoflozin (Phase 3)

**Study ID:** ZP-301-DIAB
**Date:** October 2025
**Product:** Zenoflozin (SGLT2/DPP4 Dual Inhibitor)
**Therapy Area:** Type 2 Diabetes

## Executive Summary
Zenoflozin demonstrated superior efficacy in glycemic control compared to standard metformin monotherapy. The study achieved its primary endpoint of HbA1c reduction at 24 weeks.

## Key Findings

### Efficacy
- **HbA1c Reduction:** Participants in the Zenoflozin group showed a mean reduction of **1.8%** from baseline, compared to 0.9% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the Metformin control arm (p<0.001).
- **Weight Loss:** Secondary endpoint achieved. Zenoflozin patients lost an average of **3.5 kg** over 24 weeks, distinct from weight neutral effect of Metformin.

### Safety Profile
- **Hypoglycemia:** Low incidence (2%), comparable to placebo.
- **UTI Risk:** Moderate increase in genital mycotic infections (4.5%) typical of SGLT2 class.
- **Cardiovascular:** No major adverse cardiac events (MACE) reported during the 24-week period. Long-term CVOT study ongoing.

## Conclusions
Zenoflozin offers a potent dual-mechanism approach for T2D patients uncontrolled on diet and exercise. The significant weight loss benefit differentiates it from standard DPP4 inhibitors.

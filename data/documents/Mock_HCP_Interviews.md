# Market Research: HCP Interviews (Cardiology & Endocrinology)

## Insight 1: The "Weight Loss" Distraction
"Every patient walks in asking for Ozempic because they saw it on TikTok for weight loss. It makes me skeptical. I want to treat diabetes and heart risk, not run a cosmetic weight loss clinic." -- *Dr. A, Cardiologist*

## Insight 2: The "Not My Lane" Barrier
"I know the CV data is good. But I'm a Cardiologist. I don't manage blood sugar. If I start this, do I have to monitor their A1C? I'd rather refer them back to the Endo." -- *Dr. B, Cardiologist*

## Insight 3: Adherence & Nausea
"Patients quit in the first month because of the nausea. We need to set better expectations. If they stick with it, the results are amazing, but the drop-off is high." -- *Dr. C, Endocrinologist*

## Strategic Implication
We need to shift the narrative from "Weight Loss" (which feels trivial to Cardiologists) to "CV Life Saving" (which feels urgent).

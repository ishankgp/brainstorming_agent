# Clinical Study Report: SEMAGLUTIDE-CV-001 (Ozempic)

## Executive Summary
This study evaluated the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes.

## Key Findings (Efficacy)
- **HbA1c Reduction**: Significant reduction of 1.5% vs placebo at 52 weeks.
- **Weight Loss**: Patients achieved an average weight loss of 5.5kg vs 1.2kg on placebo (p<0.001). This is a critical secondary endpoint that drives patient adherence.
- **CV Outcomes**: 26% relative risk reduction in MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events). This positions Ozempic not just as a glucose-lowering agent, but as a cardiovascular risk reduction therapy.

## Safety Profile
- **GI Side Effects**: Nausea was the most common adverse event (reported by 20% of patients), usually transient.
- **Hypoglycemia**: No significant increase in severe hypoglycemia compared to placebo.

## Sub-Group Analysis
- **Cardiologists vs. Endos**: Efficacy was consistent, but Cardiologist initiation rates remain low due to "glucocentric" perception of the drug class.

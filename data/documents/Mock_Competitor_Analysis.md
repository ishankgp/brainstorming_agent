# Competitor Intel: Trulicity & Jardiance

## Trulicity (GLP-1)
- **Positioning**: "Simple to use."
- **Status**: Strong adherence, but perceived as less potent for weight loss and CV protection than Ozempic.

## Jardiance (SGLT2)
- **Positioning**: "The Heart Failure Specialist."
- **Threat**: Cardiologists love SGLT2s because they treat Heart Failure directly. They see GLP-1s (Ozempic) as "diabetes drugs" whereas SGLT2s are "heart drugs."
- **Gap**: Ozempic needs to prove it reduces Stroke risk, which SGLT2s don't do as well.

## Market Noise
The market is crowded. EMR alerts are overwhelming. Doctors are defaulting to what they know (Metformin or SGLT2s) unless the patient pushes for Ozempic.

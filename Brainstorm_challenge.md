THE 12 “HOW CAN WE…”
CHALLENGE FORMATS
(Complete Coverage Set for pharma)

1. Core Mindset-Shift Format
Format
How can we help [TARGET AUDIENCE] move from [CURRENT MINDSET / BEHAVIOR] to
[DESIRED MINDSET / BEHAVIOR], without [KEY FEAR, RISK, OR BARRIER]?
When to use
 Behavior is entrenched
 Change feels risky
 Tradeoffs dominate decision-making
Example
How can we help physicians move from habitual prescribing to deliberate stroke prevention,
without increasing fear of bleeding risk?

2. Reframing Format
Format
How can we reframe [CURRENT BELIEF] as [NEW, MORE EMPOWERING BELIEF]?
When to use
 Mental models are outdated
 Education alone won’t shift behavior
 The category is stuck in a narrative
Example
How can we reframe early intervention as responsible care rather than escalation?

3. Permission-Giving Format
Format
How can we give [TARGET AUDIENCE] permission to [DESIRED ACTION] without
violating their sense of caution or responsibility?
When to use
 Audience already “knows” but hesitates
 Emotional or professional risk dominates
 Fear of judgment or blame is present
Example
How can we give dermatologists permission to treat earlier without compromising long-term
safety confidence?

4. Role-Clarification Format
Format
How can we clearly define our role in [JOURNEY / DECISION MOMENT] without
overreaching beyond our evidence?
When to use
 Category is crowded
 Differentiation comes from timing
 “Why this now?” is unclear
Example
How can we define this therapy’s role at a critical treatment moment without overstating its
breadth?

5. Differentiation-Through-Restraint Format
Format
How can we stand apart by focusing on [SPECIFIC STRENGTH] instead of [CATEGORY
NORM]?
When to use
 Competitors are over-claiming

 Trust and credibility matter most
 The brand wins by not being everything
Example
How can we stand apart by focusing on dependable prevention rather than maximal claims?

6. Simplification Format
Format
How can we simplify [COMPLEX DECISION / INFORMATION] so that [TARGET
AUDIENCE] can act with confidence?
When to use
 Decision fatigue is high
 Data overload is paralyzing action
 The brand’s value is clarity
Example
How can we simplify treatment sequencing so oncologists can act decisively?

7. Confidence-Building Format
Format
How can we reinforce confidence in [DESIRED DECISION / BEHAVIOR] when [EXTERNAL
PRESSURE OR DOUBT] is working against it?
When to use
 Belief exists but is eroding
 Competitive or policy pressure creates doubt
 Creative must reassure, not persuade
Example
How can we reinforce confidence in oral therapies when injectables dominate the conversation?

8. Redefining Success Format
Format

How can we redefine what “success” looks like in [CATEGORY / CONDITION] beyond
[TRADITIONAL METRIC]?
When to use
 Outcomes are narrowly defined
 The brand offers broader or longer-term value

Example
How can we redefine success in psoriasis beyond short-term clearance?

THE EDGE-CASE 10%
These address situations most frameworks miss.

9. Risk-of-Inaction Format (Edge Case)
Format
How can we make the cost of not acting visible without resorting to fear or alarmism?
When to use
 Inertia is the biggest threat
 Status quo feels “safe”
 Under-treatment is normalized
Example
How can we make the long-term cost of untreated inflammation visible without exaggeration?

10. Trust-Repair Format (Edge Case)
Format
How can we rebuild trust in [CATEGORY / BRAND / APPROACH] without defending past
assumptions?
When to use
 Category or mechanism has lost credibility

 Skepticism is emotional, not rational
 Over-explaining makes things worse
Example
How can we rebuild trust in oral therapies without dismissing past limitations?

11. Paradigm-Shift Format (Edge Case)
Format
How can we help the audience let go of [OLD PARADIGM] and adopt [NEW PARADIGM]
without feeling reckless or irresponsible?
When to use
 Standards of care are changing
 The audience risks being “left behind”
 Identity and expertise are threatened
Example
How can we help oncologists move beyond line-of-therapy thinking without undermining
clinical rigor?

12. Behavior-Maintenance Format (Edge Case)
Format
How can we help [TARGET AUDIENCE] stay committed to [DESIRED BEHAVIOR] over
time, even when urgency fades?
When to use
 Initial adoption is strong, but persistence lags
 The work is about durability, not conversion
 Success requires long-term reinforcement
Example
How can we help physicians remain committed to preventive care even when patients appear
stable?

CHALLENGE EVALUATION &amp; VALIDATION
FRAMEWORK
Purpose
To assess whether the selected Challenge:
 Is strategically correct
 Is grounded in real insight and data
 Is appropriate for the brand’s lifecycle
 Can realistically be solved by creative communication

EVALUATION CRITERIA (8 DIMENSIONS)
Each dimension can be scored (e.g., 1–5) or reviewed qualitatively.

1. Business Relevance
Key Question
Does this Challenge directly address the primary business problem defined in the Client
Marketing Brief and Integrated Launch Plan?
What to Check
 Alignment with stated launch or growth objectives
 Clear line of sight to success metrics (trial, adoption, readiness, etc.)
 Addresses the biggest barrier, not a secondary symptom
Red Flags
 Challenge sounds insightful but doesn’t move KPIs
 Solves for awareness when the plan calls for conversion
 Feels “nice to have” rather than mission-critical

2. Audience Truth
Key Question
Is this Challenge grounded in how the target audience actually thinks and behaves?
What to Check
 Consistency with qualitative research, field insights, advisory boards

 Resonance with known motivations, fears, and pressures
 Realistic portrayal of decision-making context
Red Flags
 Challenge reflects internal brand frustration, not audience reality
 Over-intellectualized or abstract
 Requires the audience to behave “unlike themselves”

3. Insight Strength
Key Question
Is the Challenge rooted in a true insight, not an observation or assumption?
What to Check
 Tension or contradiction in beliefs or behaviors
 Something the audience feels but rarely articulates
 Evidence of “why now” pressure
Red Flags
 Restates category facts (“It’s a crowded market”)
 Describes the brand problem, not the human problem
 Could apply equally to every competitor

4. Data &amp; Evidence Alignment
Key Question
Can this Challenge be credibly supported by the brand’s data and evidence base?
What to Check
 Compatibility with clinical data and label
 Support from real-world evidence or experience
 Alignment with what sales teams can confidently say
Red Flags
 Requires claims or implications the data can’t support
 Forces creative to stretch or imply
 Depends on future data not yet available (especially pre-launch)

5. Lifecycle Appropriateness
Key Question
Is this Challenge appropriate for the brand’s lifecycle stage?
Pre-Launch
 Establishes clarity and credibility
 Avoids over-promising or over-positioning
Post-Launch
 Addresses real market feedback
 Allows evolution without identity whiplash
Red Flags
 Feels too bold or disruptive for launch
 Feels too conservative for a stalled brand
 Ignores launch timing or market maturity

6. Strategic Focus
Key Question
Is the Challenge singular, or is it trying to solve too much?
What to Check
 One primary tension, not a list
 Clear prioritization over secondary issues
 Creative can realistically address it
Red Flags
 Multiple “ands”
 Attempts to fix messaging, perception, and behavior at once
 Requires multiple Challenge formats simultaneously

7. Creative Solvability
Key Question
Can this Challenge be meaningfully addressed by creative communication?
What to Check

 Creative ideas can plausibly shift perception or belief
 The Challenge doesn’t depend on access, price, or logistics
 Allows for multiple creative territories
Red Flags
 Root cause is policy, reimbursement, or supply
 Would require sales force behavior change, not messaging

8. Longevity &amp; Scalability
Key Question
Can this Challenge support sustained creative work over time?
What to Check
 Relevance beyond a single campaign
 Ability to flex across channels and audiences
 Durability as the brand matures
Red Flags

FINAL GATE: THE “NON-NEGOTIABLES” CHECK
A Challenge should not proceed if:
